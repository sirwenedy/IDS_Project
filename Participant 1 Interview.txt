Ayokunle Afolalu  
Okay, I'm just going to ask you some questions I need for the research of the project, so you don't have to answer all of them. You can just answer the ones that you have answers to. It's perfectly fine. Okay, so, alright. The questions are centered around intrusion detection systems, basically in the professional technical environment. So the first question, can you describe any general experience with managing or using IDSs  in professional cyber security environment.

Participant 1  
Um, okay, like I said earlier during our chat, I have not worked personally with an IDS in my environment, in the place I work, but as an MSSP, we provide security services to other companies, financial institutions, and these companies do have the IDs and the IPs in the environment which we onboard to the SIEM, we get logs from IDs and the rest of them. So I have been able to onboard an IDS to the SIEM but working with the IDS itself, I have not done that.  

Ayokunle Afolalu  
Okay, that's fine. Okay. So do you do you have any idea how this IDSS are deployed to, like, monitor or protect against cyber threats.

Speaker 1  
Well, for my own knowledge, the IDs, I have seen about two or three of them. They are usually integrated with the firewall. So the firewall, let's say Sophus firewall, it has the IDS capabilities. It has the IDS features embedded in it. it has the IDs. It has the IPs. Some even have the waf embedded in them. So they all come with the different services embedded in the Sophus, or Fortigate and the rest so on the so forth. I would like the ones they have seen. You see IDs logs speaking to suspicious activities. Maybe a suspicious IP is communicating with your environment, or a suspicious traffic, anormal traffic communicating with the environment. You could see logs for that, and we can see that it's coming from the IDs. And what the IDS does is just lets you know that this traffic is anomalous. It's not normal. It might be suspicious and the rest, but it's just like an informational stuff here. It lets you know if it was allowed or if it was stopped, or anything. If you already have it blocked on your firewall, it will let you know that it was stopped on all of that. But the idea is, on its own, is basically an informative tool. It lets you know that, okay, these things are happening, but it doesn't take any action to, like, stop it and the rest that will be the job of the IPs or whatever other whatever else is embedded in the firewall, like all the ones I have seen.

Ayokunle Afolalu  
Okay. Thank you. So what role do you think IDs  play in overall cyber strategy of an organization?

Speaker 1  
Well, like I said, I think it plays an informational role. It is important. It gives you an information that okay, these things are happening, but because I have no much experience using it. I would not want to state it as if I'm stating facts, but I would think that the firewall generally, or the IPS, could do some of the stuff that you need it to do. I feel like the IDS is not like that's important. It is important. Yeah, but I will not say that it is one of the most important tools to have in your environment. If you have an IPS, plus, at least the IPS prevents those kind of communications. If you get what I'm saying, yes, It stops anomalous. If it sees that the signal or the pattern is unusual, it could literally stop it and they rest. So I think those who hold but they do work hand in hand, they detect and they stop it. So I won't want to underplay the functionality of the IDs. But like I said, I lack enough knowledge on that aspect, because I have not interfaced with it personally in my own environment, to know that, okay, this is exactly what it does. Like I said, I see logs from it. I have not worked with it personally, yeah, but I think it is important for I would say some other tools may also be able to carry out those functions.

Ayokunle Afolalu  
 Before I continue. You. I just want to let you know that there are 13 questions. We can just skip through it. I'm sorry,

Participant 1  
yeah, let us see as fast as we can move

Ayokunle Afolalu  
 Okay, this is number four. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, oh, from what you've seen from maybe the companies that you talked about that you've seen logs from IDSS and like, maybe worked with them, like, in a third party way. what challenges do you think they have when using this IDS systems

Speaker 1  
that might not be a question I can answer, because I have not worked with it. Personally. I have not known the challenge, the challenges I might face my own end. Like I said, You know what an MSSP is, right? Yes. Okay, so for my own end, when I onboard a log source like an IDS on IPs. One of my jobs is to create rules or use cases what I see the logs bringing in. So let's get value from what I am seeing. I'm supposed to create use cases that will trigger when a suspicious activity is happening, something that makes sense to the customer. So sometimes my own for my own end, the logs may not be as clear as I would want it to be. There are some log sources that give you clear indication of something. They can just tell you this is happening lets say a suspicious IP was blocked, straightforward, like that, but not in all cases. Sometimes you could see IDs logs, and all they will see is IDs activity that will be the name of the log, of the name of the log itself, you have to troubleshoot maybe look for different fields to pick out something meaningful from it. Maybe look at the device action. Or there are other different fields that we might have to look at to be able to create a rule from it. Okay, when the name is this and this other field matches, then okay, this is what is happening. So it takes a lot to, like, understand them and work with them. That's my own challenge, from my own point of view, working with it directly, like I said, I have not so I cannot give you what an actual challenge will be with working with IDs in the customer environment.

Ayokunle Afolalu  
Yeah, I understand. Okay. Thank you. So the next question is, obviously, using this IDS system there will be, there will probably be some false positives alerts there will be some of them. So how do you think this impacts the security operations of an organization?

Participant 1  
Yes, so false positives are quite a lot in the security industry, because we work with the zero trust policy, so we have to check everything. So we have a lot of false positive flagging, which we have to check and make sure, okay, this thing is actually not a threat or is not an activity that we should be worried about. So yes, it affects and there are a lot, but that's where we as MSSP comes in. We try to filter and fine tune and narrow it down to reduce the false positive so that anytime our use case is flagged, yes, there will still be some false positive, but it should not be all the time. If an IDS activity, that it should be something worth checking, you get so who could do different things? I'm trying to paint a scenario that would make sense. normally, there'll be some kind of stuff that flag all the time. There are some activities in an environment that mimics a threat activity, or I will put it like that. So these activities that happen maybe every time in an environment, maybe, okay, let's say in the environment, they visit a website everyday, okay, to gather information about threat activities, let's say an intelligence website, or whatever. And because of the kind of activity that happened on that website, the IDS will pick it has an anomalous behavior because, ah, this website, things have happened there before, whatever. I'm just placing a scenario now. Yeah, so picking up the activity as a suspicious activity. But when we confirm with the customer that this activity that you guys do, the IDS is picking it up, they can't tell us, okay, this is something we do everyday, or once a week, we visit the site to get some information. Our security posture to make sure nothing leaks and whatever to collect. Okay, so for this particular activity, we could whitelist it, because we know that at this point, every time or every day every week, the customer does this legitimately. You. We can whitelist that activity or the particular users that are involved. If the report comes with a username or whatever, we can whitelist something that speaks to that activity so that that activity do not flag anymore. Yeah. Or let's see the particular host usually whitelist activities to reduce the noise and thereby using the false positive. So let's say that particular activity, they confirm to us that we usually visit this website from this host. So we could whitelist this host. The next time we see an activity from another host in the environment to that website, then we could flag it to them. Then they cannot tell us, ah, we are not the one that did this. Let's investigate or be like, Okay, we decided to go from this was this other time, that's why. But that way we are not going to receiving it everyday, once in a while time when something else happens, we'll flag it for them. So it might still be a false positive but it has reduced the way it happens.

Ayokunle Afolalu  
 Thank you very much. So how do IDs is um, integrate with with other security systems like IPs, SIEM and SOAR

Speaker 1  
alright? So, like I would say, in my experience, I have not seen a standalone IDs. I've not worked with a standalone IDs. The IDs I have seen, I have seen for Sophos, I have seen for ehm, Fortigate, yeah, they both come with a firewall. So there are, I think there are services that are features that come with the firewall. So you could, I don't know how they do it, but you could pay, maybe when you, when the customers purchase this source from the vendors, they pay for other services. Okay, we want the IDS service, we want the WAF and all of that you pay for it. So I've not seen a stand alone IDs. So it's always on the two. I've seen those two sophos and fortigate. They come with the firewall. So it's, I would say it's a seamless integration with the firewall. You just go there, work with it, you block the IPs that your IDs has reported. It's very straightforward. Then integrating with the SIEM still, I integrated the firewall, and I get the IPS and the IDS block because it's already coming in the firewall. So it's, I would say it's a seamless integration for my own end and the customer ends It might be different. Maybe when you interview other people, they were able to give you a better view on that. But for my end, it's seamless intergrateing the IDs. All I do is integrate, the firewall, and I get the IDs and the IPS logs.

Ayokunle Afolalu  
Okay, that makes sense. Thank you. So the next question, there are anomaly based IDs systems and signature based IDs systems. So do you know factors that could influence the choice to pick one of these to use in the workplace?

Participant 1  
Like I said, I have not it is the customers that integrate this into the environment, and I see them, but from general knowledge, when you will ask the question, again, normally based on what, based on signature based, this is a tough one, I would say, because both are equally Important to in every environment, signature based will pick up patterns that they have seen happened in other environments, or whatever you work with, what's already on ground, like information that they already have ingested to the IDs to recognize those signatures, that's also important, then anomaly based. So I feel like anomaly base is also very good, because we recognize the normal part and identity that goes outside that it might flag it. But I feel that would also come with a lot of false positive, because when you work in an enterprise environment, there are a lot of people doing different things here. Yeah. So it will be picking up regular activities also because different people are involved and all of that. Well, I don't think I'm the good position to answer that question, so I rather skip that.

Ayokunle Afolalu  
Alright, thank you.  So do you know how the organizations evaluate the effectiveness of IDs? Like, what metrics do they use ,Are they bigger on accuracy, or response time? Or do what metric Do you think the they use most like that is most valuable to them.

Participant 1  
and that I want to be able to answer on that, able to answer that, I have, there's a customer that they are very they take the IDS logs very important. So anything that is flagged by the IDs, any for any IP that the flag has suspicious or whatever, they usually take it very serious, and they investigate and they block it across their own, the across the whole environment, if they have understood, okay, this IP we are not the one that visited it, or is actually malicious. So they always, we created a rule to always pick up the IDS events for them, IDs, events they think they they specifically requested for it. So anytime this IDs flags, anything we want to see it, put this on a medium severity, or a low or, you know, a severity that they can easily pick up. So I would say they value it, but in the way you're asking, I will not know, ,

Ayokunle Afolalu  
okay, thank you so the the IDS systems. So do you think they use older data sets  or newer?

Participant 1  
So it depends on the company. From our own end, we do provide such intelligence for our customers. We provide IOCs, RF IPs and Tor IPs, let me not say Tor, because Tor is always changing, but we provide IOCs for them. So we have malicious hashes, Suspicious hashes, suspicious IP addresses, suspicious URLs. Yeah. So we send them across our customer. Every time our intelligence gathers the information, we send them to the customer. So the customer uploads this information across their environment, including their IDs, including that some of them are antivirus compatible. So you upload them to your antivirus, to your EDRs and your xdrs. You get if we are the ones controlling those things for you, we upload them for you. If you are the one controlling them, you upload them on your end. So I would say, regularly updated. Okay, regularly updated, okay, yes,

Ayokunle Afolalu  
okay, thank you so much. Does that's all the questions. Okay, thank you for your time. Like I really appreciate it. Your your input is really going to help out with the project. I honestly can't. Alright, thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah, success, yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much. Alright, enjoy the rest of your day. You too.

Participant 1  
Alright, bye bye, bye, bye.
